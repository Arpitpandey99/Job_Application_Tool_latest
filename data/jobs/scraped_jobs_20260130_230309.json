This dilution of focus has led to bottlenecks, delays, and inconsistent quality\u2014particularly in benchmark creation and novel evaluation datasets.To address these challenges, we propose a dedicated ML Lead role focused exclusively on research, conceptualization, and direction-setting for benchmarks and evaluations, without direct implementation responsibilities. This role will define the novelty, quality, and strategic direction of benchmarks, while leading a small team of specialized MLEs responsible for execution and pipeline development.This structure enables faster delivery, higher-quality benchmarks, and stronger alignment with both research goals and client-facing requirements.2. Purpose of the RoleThe ML Lead will be responsible for driving innovation in AI evaluation at DeccanAI by:Designing and proposing novel benchmarks and evaluation datasets aligned with the latest AI research.Identifying gaps in existing evaluation methodologies across coding and non-coding domains.Leading and mentoring a focused MLE team responsible for implementation and pipeline execution.Ensuring consistent, high-quality benchmark output for both research initiatives and client deliverables.3. Key Responsibilities1. Benchmark & Evaluation Design (Primary Responsibility)Propose at least one novel benchmark or evaluation project per week across coding (e.g., algorithmic tasks, agentic coding) and non-coding domains (e.g., NLP, CV, multimodal, agent frameworks).Identify limitations in existing benchmarks and design new evaluation criteria that push current AI evaluation standards.Conceptualize and propose novel evaluation datasets to support these benchmarks.2. High-Level Requirements & DocumentationProduce a clear, high-level requirement document for every proposed benchmark, including:Objective and motivationEvaluation criteria and metricsTesting methodologyExpected outcomesEnsure documentation provides sufficient clarity for MLEs to implement efficiently without ambiguity.3. Technical Leadership & Team ManagementLead and mentor MLEs responsible for pipeline design, validation, and execution.Ensure alignment of MLE efforts with organizational research goals and client requirements.Coordinate execution across multiple benchmark and pipeline initiatives.4. Client Interaction & Requirement AlignmentParticipate in client discussions to understand evaluation needs and expectations.Translate client requirements into benchmark-level specifications.Enable client-facing MLEs with the necessary context and guidance for successful delivery.Provide constructive and positive feedback to clients on task feasibility and requirements.5. Continuous Innovation & ImprovementStay current with advances in AI research, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies.Regularly refine benchmarks based on research insights, client feedback, and evolving market needs.Collaborate with internal teams to evolve existing benchmarks and datasets.6. Strategic RecommendationsPropose improvements to benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation pipelines based on research insights and stakeholder feedback.Contribute to long-term strategy around AI evaluation and benchmarking at DeccanAI.4. Team Structure Under the ML LeadPipeline-Focused MLEsResponsible for implementing, validating, and executing pipelines based on ML Lead proposals.Support both research and client-facing benchmark deployments.Benchmark Research MLEsConduct supporting research and collaborate with the ML Lead to propose novel benchmarks and evaluations on a weekly basis.5. Expected Output & Delivery CadenceTwo new benchmarks every two weeks (initially starting with one):One coding-domain benchmarkOne non-coding-domain benchmarkHigh-level requirement documentation for every benchmark.Client-ready deliverables, validated through robust pipelines and aligned with defined evaluation criteria.6. Clear Separation of ResponsibilitiesML Lead (Ownership):Research, ideation, and conceptual design of benchmarks and evaluation datasets.Defining novelty, quality standards, and evaluation direction.High-level documentation and requirements definition.Pipeline-Focused MLEs (Execution):Pipeline development and integration.Benchmark implementation and validation.Direct client-facing execution and requirement clarification.This separation ensures deep focus on innovation at the ML Lead level while enabling efficient and scalable execution by MLEs.7. Seniority & Skillset RequirementsThe ideal ML Lead will have:Deep expertise in AI/ML domains including agent frameworks, NLP, deep learning, multimodal systems, and computer vision.Proven experience designing benchmarks, evaluation datasets, and research-driven evaluation frameworks.Strong leadership and mentorship skills for guiding MLE teams.Excellent documentation and communication skills, capable of explaining complex ideas to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.A strong understanding of existing AI benchmarks across coding and non-coding domains, with the ability to identify and address evaluation gaps.",
